#What Is Image Classification?
Image Classification assigns an input image, one label from a fixed set of categories. This is one of the core problems in Computer Vision that, despite its simplicity, has many practical applications.

#-Steps of the model :
Step 1: Import the required libraries
Step 2: Load the data
Step 3: Visualize the data
Step 4: Preprocess and augment the data
Step 5: Define the model
Step 6: Evaluate the result
